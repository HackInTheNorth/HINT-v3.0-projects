This application will save a lot of time when we don't have enough time to watch the whole video or listen to whole audio (recorded speech). We can just run our application and it will give a small summary of the video and audio.
We will also try to implement a chrome extension which can do the same.

                        प्रत्येित ( Believe ) - A dependable decentralised subnet for crime vigilance and safe navigation.
Our app aims at adding another feature to the current navigation system used by people in day-to-day life. The feature, as we call it is “safe-navigation”. It allows you to not only find the shortest route from origin to destination but also the safest- based on the trends in crimes recorded along all possible routes over a certain period of time. For this, we plan to create clusters based upon latitudes and longitudes of recorded crimes. We will assign these clusters a “danger index” based upon the types, density and date of these recorded crimes. Then we will use these clusters to calculate a heuristic function for an AI-algorithm to traverse each possible step of all possible routes and calculate a final “safety-index” of each route. These “safety-indices” will be assigned to the routes on-demand and hence will change with the time at which a user plans to use the app, as a route might be comparatively less safe at certain times than others. We also plan to provide the user with a visual interface for seeing the above-mentioned “crime-clusters” and heat maps of various categories of crime. 

To accomplish this task, our main hinderance was the absence of a reliable source of data on crimes committed in our country. Very few, if any, recorded FIRs are ever made public. Also, due of lack of transparency in the way crime is reported to the police, these FIRs are easy to manipulate and hence any public records of these generated by the current system is lacking in reliability. Thus to solve this problem, we plan to create a blockchain architecture of recording these FIRs so that a public ledger of every FIR recorded is present on a server at every police station which is a part of our blockchain network. This will ensure that no individual-be it a person with authority or a common man-can manipulate this information. Using this information we plan on generating a reliable database that can be used by our cluster of AI-models to give a new dimension to current standards of navigation.

If successfully implemented, we can easily migrate the current records of FIRs to our blockchain for preserving their authenticity while providing a method to record all the new FIRs to the blockchain network directly. This architecture will also be able to replace our current system of filing online FIRs which is lacking any sorts of authentication- with a more secure, reliable and trustworthy method.

                          Automatic Trolley Human Follower:

This project aims to make an Automatic Trolley Human Follower for general or industrial user that is affordable. The main objective is to reduce the cost yet increase the reliability, provide a viable and convenient way of carrying luggage for the public and especially for the old and specially abled. An automatic trolley human follower is developed to help a user or production industry to reduce the utilization of human energy in order to carry heavy things. This automatic trolley human follower is controlled by an Arduino, that can follow the user automatically using a combination of ultrasonic range sensors, bluetooth modules, accelerometer, gyroscope and also uses a fingerprint sensor and camera. GPS is not being used as to make the process more fast and accurate.

                        Provides a text summary of the video you want to watch. Another great functionality our app provides is the minify feature, that gives out a crunched video of the original video as opposed to the text summary. Both these features are especially helpful for students when they have an exam and have to quickly go through a concept or idea. If we're able to efficiently implement this, we'll implement other features like translating the summary to the desired language and audio summary.

                        Our product is basically about creating digital certificates  for the attendees or the winners of an event.This would actually reduce the paper work and people would be able provide a link to their digital certificate instead of carrying it everywhere.Moreover through Machine Learning we will automate the process of selecting the suitable candidates for the event/competition.With the limited time we have decided to take the product in a particular direction i.e making it for Hackathons. Participants would be issued a digital certificate depicting they were a part of the Hackathon. Moreover selection of candidates will be automated through our Machine Learning Algorithm hence speeding up the entire process.

                  The current voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, etc., have only one source of input i.e., Voice. This renders the wide range of features presented by these assistants like voice controlled home systems, etc., useless for the Dumb Demographics of the society. But given the fact that we have a world wide standard available for these people to communicate, we decided to make a hardware extension for the Amazon Echo/Google Assistant/Apple Pod which involves a camera module, a microphone, and a speaker.
We are using the standard ASL language as a basis for the gesture recognition. Alexa records the gestures performed by the user, analyses them from a given set of commands, the one to which it matches with the maximum probability is chosen and then send to Alexa for a response to be generated which is then spoken out.

                  In our modern world we have so many appliances in house that work at the same time. In order to keep ourselves in check we came up with the idea of Smart-Energy-Meter. The system measures the amount of energy that is being consumed on the daily basis by using data from Electricity meter. The system is programmed using current slab rate for bill calculation. By using IoT we can control the appliances remotely. The system will also help in preventing loss of energy or theft.

                  Twitter Utilities App:
This application project tends to solve three major real life problems that people encounter while using twitter. The app will only require your twitter handle as an initial input.
1.)        Predicting the number of likes and re-tweets that you might be getting on any tweet of yours, based on your profile status, and also based on the post’s timestamp. 
2.)        This app will help you get a summary of the tweets of the people you follow for the past one day ranging up to one week, as per your requirement.
3.)         Time to add some fancy stuff. Suppose you want to post a tweet in the style of some famous personality. This app will you do the same on the go. Just enter some text and the tweet will be generated in the style of your choice. Additionally, we will also predict the number of likes that you will get depending on when you post the tweet.

                  Our project tries to solve a general problem of parents, which is the monitoring the child's use time of his mobile, but in a more playful nature.   We plan to design a custom launcher application for android, which will track and monitor the time spent by the child on other apps. The child has a specified time limit of using the other apps, in completion of which the launcher closes the app. To reopen it, the child has to play some educational games, developed in three.js. The games will be developed by the community and the user involvement in a particular game fetches them more blocks. Also, the parents can monitor how much the time their child spends on a particular app, and in which games he is more interested in.

Most of the accidents happen due to the driver feeling 
drowsy, while being on a long drive or on a highway.
Therefore to save those precious lives, the app comes to
the rescue. **Prevention is better than cure and certainly better
than being deceased.**

 * An app that prevent accidents while driving.
 * Forces the user to keep his eyes open.
 * Has an eye exercise if user is feeling sleepy.
 * Can send messages to contacts if an accident occurs.
 * Alerts the driver to keep his phone in-front of him for
 the app to be functional.

                  Using disease profiles which contains severity and symptoms, our code first predicts the possible disease the person can have. Now, we help the user by providing useful blogs and resources like medications, doctors to consult, home remedies, precautions, etc from all over the web. We will be having user accounts, and thus the user will upvote and downvote the resources based on his/her experience. Also, if a disease is encountered for the first time, the search algorithm is used for that time and the data is stored for any further requests. We also plan to recommend future complications or disease that the user might get into if the severity of the current symptoms increases and what all precautionary measures to avoid them.

                  Ever felt disappointing to read a research paper, because you cant understand most of the terms? Our hack solves the problem!! We use python's advanced NLP( Natural Language Processor) libraries and several other API's to solve the above problem mentioned. Provided a research document we will try to extract the summary of the research document and find the relevant links which provide extra information about the terms in the document. These links will be based on the keywords and the necessary theme of the document. The hack will be helpful for the people who want to start out in a particular field.

                  Problem : Food In-Security

Household Food security exists when all members at all time have access to enough food for an active healthy life. Individuals who are food secured do not live in hunger or fear of starvation . Food insecurity on the other hand is the situation of uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability """"------ to acquire acceptable food in socially acceptable ways ------"""" according to United States Dept. of Agriculture.

Hack : AKSHAYAPATRA

This hack will provide- Availability of food to the needy. Access to everyone. """"""Utilisation of wastage"""""".

UTILISATION OF WASTAGE----------------------------------------

There are people(Restaurants, Marriage Halls, Households) who want to serve their excess food to the needy but do not have a medium to communicate. Even on the other side, the needy do not know who is ready to fulfill their needs.

Due to this disconnection in the communication, there is a lot of """"""FOOD WASTAGE"""""" . Let's prevent it then.

                  # Decentralized-Review-Platform
It's a Decentralized Review Platform built on top of Ethereum

## What's the issue?
------------------------
Today, most of the community review systems are owned by ""Big"" centralized organisations like Amazon, Google etc. These organisations when required often influence users contents on the platform to improve their odds in market. Also, duue to centralized nature, present systems can be highly effected if the company went down.

## Proposed Solution?
--------------------------
So here we propose a solution to the problem by developing a Decentralized Review Platform using Etherum Ecosystem. This enables us to deliver a temper-proof, highly reliable & trusted community platform for reviews & ratings. It's a community review system on which user can just write review for 'link' to the 'restraunts','hotels' ,'produ   cts' or 'website'.

## Innovation?   
---------------------------
It's gives power to each and every individual by assuring them that their voices cannot be put down by ""Big"" Organisations for their profit. Our system emphasis on user experience & simplicity by abstracting most of the technical aspects. 

More on that, we will also integrate this system with Zulip Platform, to categorize all the reviews provided by the users into several categories/topics based on sentiments, product, etc. It'll help organisations to know about discussions going in their products & reach their customers.
 
## More... 
---------------------------
We'll also create a modular ""Disqus"" like plugin which can be added to any project page.

## What Technology Stack?
----------------------------
 - **Web** : ReactJS, Flask (TBD), HTML, CSS
 - **Blockchain** : Ethereum (Truffle) & Solidity
 - **Machine Learning** : MS Azure,
 - **Others** : Markdown

                  TenderChicken<br>

TenderChicken is a blockchain(smart contracts) based application where government organisations can release tenders for several requirements and different parties can submit their applications for any open tender.

TenderChicken lets the applicants only publish the hash of their applications initially until the deadline of accepting tenders gets over. These hashes are stored in the blockchain and hence remain immutable and tamper proof. Once no further applications are accepted for the Tender, the applicants need to publish the original applications. The hashes of the uploaded files are matched with previously stored hashes and the matched ones are selected as legitimate applications.

It prevents any organisation to preview the applications before the deadline. If any corrupt organisation can preview the applications, they can make adjustments with several other parties for sending applications with lesser bid values.
